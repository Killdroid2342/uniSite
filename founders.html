                    class="altWordGradiant">Mohamed Al-Shaibi</span>
                to bring more creativity and collaboration to campus life. Wanting students to have a space to try new
                ideas and make things together, he began building events that mix art, fun, and community. Co-Founder
                Cecelia Moscatelli was able to support the project by helping shape the vision and adding her skills to
                make each event come to life. Together, they've made ImpactSBCC a hub for activities like bead
                jewelry-making, tote bag painting, and canvas roulette giving students not just a club to join, but a
                place to create, connect, and leave their mark on SBCC.
